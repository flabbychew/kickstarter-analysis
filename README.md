# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
  The goal of this analysis was to help Louise make an informed decision when creating her own Kickstarter campaign so that it can be as successful as possible. In order to accomplish this, I looked at data from other similar kickstarter projects and analyzed it so to determine what parameters would lead to the most successful campaign for Louise to create. 

**When to Launch?**

  I began performing my analysis by creating a pivot table which showed the outcomes of launching a campaign under the theatre category during certain months of the year. Using this pivot chart I made a line chart which highlights that most successful campaigns are launched in the month of May. This analysis helped inform Louise about the best month for her to launch her campaign if she wants it to reach it's goal, as well as the months she should avoid launching her project in. We can conclude that May has the highest probablility of success and that Louise should avoid launching in December at all costs. ![Theater Outcomes vs Launch](https://github.com/flabbychew/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outacomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true)

**How Much to Ask?**

  Once the best time to launch a campaign had been determined, the next step was to decide what goal amount would be the most likely to be reached based upon the successes and failures of previous plays fundraising attempts. I determined this by using the "COUNTIFS" function to create a chart I would use to visualize the success of projects based on their goals. Looking at the graph I determined that as the goal increased generally the success of the campaign fell, up until a goal of $25,000 dollars, in which it rose. This trend continued until the $40,000 goal mark in which the success rate dropped again. Ultimately the highest rate of success was for projects whose goals were very low, and Louise should use this data to set her goal as low as possible in order to gain funding. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/flabbychew/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png?raw=true)
