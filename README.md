# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The goal of this analysis was to help Louise make an informed decision when creating her own Kickstarter campaign so that it can be as successful as possible.
I began performing my analysis by creating a pivot table which showed the outcomes of launching a campaign under the theatre category during certain months of the year. Using this pivot chart I made a line chart which highlights that most campaigns that are successful are launched in th month of May. ![Theater Outcomes vs Launch](https://github.com/flabbychew/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outacomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true)
