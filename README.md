# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The goal of this analysis was to help Louise make an informed decision when creating her own Kickstarter campaign so that it can be as successful as possible.
I began performing my analysis by creating a pivot table which showed the outcomes of launching a campaign under the theatre category during certain months of the year. Using this pivot chart I made a line chart which highlights that most successful campaigns are launched in the month of May. This analysis helped inform Louise about the best month for her to launch her campaign if she wants it to reach it's goal. ![Theater Outcomes vs Launch](https://github.com/flabbychew/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outacomes_vs_Launch.png?raw=true)
Once the best time to launch a campaign had been determined, the next step was to decide what goal amount would be the most likely to be reached based upon the successes and failures of previous plays fundraising.
